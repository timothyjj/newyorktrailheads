<h1>Adirondack Trail Listings</h1>

<p>The Adirondack Park covers 6.1 million acres in northern New York. Countless trails climb up mountains, meander through forests, and take hikers to scenic viewpoints. On this page, you'll find links to several Adirondack hikes that we recommend.</p> 

<p>We've primarily covered trails in the southeastern region, many within an hour's drive of the general Capital Region. Even when hiking an easy Adirondack trail, remember that you are often heading into wilderness regions. Know your route, bring plenty of food and water, and ensure that you're wearing proper clothing before heading into the woods.</p>
