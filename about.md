The goal of New York Trailheads is to encourage upstate New York residents and visitors to enjoy the great outdoors. Go for a hike or a bike ride on one of the many countless trails available!

While many sites exist cataloging lists of hikes, we've found it difficult at times to pinpoint parking areas for trailheads. Finding some trails can result in confusion, searching through information on multiple sites to determine where to park and start out on the trail. We want to provide you with up-to-date maps pinpointing the exact spots where trails start.

Along with trailhead maps, we'll show pictures of locations, so you know what kinds of views to expect. Finally, we'll feature tips for hiking, biking, and making your outdoor experience safe and enjoyable.

We primarily focus on the Capital Region and Southern Adirondacks because of where we spend most of our time enjoying the outdoors. However, we'd love to include information about other trails around the state. Please feel free to send us information for trails you'd like to see listed. Also, don't forget to check out our social media pages!

Also, as a disclaimer, we do our best to keep information up-to-date about trail locations and descriptions but can't be held accountable for information that ends up being inaccurate (please contact us if you do find any sections that need updating). However, note that trails may periodically be closed due to damage or maintenance.

In addition, you are ultimately responsible for your safety. Plan out your hikes carefully, know where you're going, dress for potential weather changes, and bring sufficient food and water. Don't hike alone in wilderness areas.
