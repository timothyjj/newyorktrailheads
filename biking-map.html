<h1>Biking Map</h1>

Besides hiking trails, the Capital Region of New York State is home to a number of great trails for biking. These trails are well maintained, with significant paved portions, frequently following the course of old railroads or canal paths. See the map for suggested parking areas to ride each trail.<br />
