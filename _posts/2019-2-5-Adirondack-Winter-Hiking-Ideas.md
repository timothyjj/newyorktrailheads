<h1>Three Adirondack Winter Hiking Ideas</h1>

<p>In the North Country, the arrival of snow and freezing temperatures doesn't have to mean that you're stuck inside for 4 months. With <a href="http://newyorktrailheads.com/2017/01/14/Winter-Hiking-Tips.html">the right gear and preparation</a>, you can enjoy a day outside in winter just as much as during the rest of the year. Here are a few options for hiking (or snowshoeing) in the Adirondacks when snow covers the ground.</p>

<h2>Camp Santanoni</h2>

<p>A great destination for families or those looking for an easier trek, this historic great camp is a popular winter destination. Several restored buildings dot the landscape of this extensive property. You can snowshoe or cross-country ski a 5-mile path (one way) to reach the main camp building. A shorter 1-mile route leads to the Farm building.</p>

<h2>Pack Demonstration Forest</h2>

<p>This site, which serves as a camp in the summer, is open to the public in the winter. A short nature trail and roads leading to frozen water and scenes of mountains in the distance make for relatively easy walking, snowshoeing, or skiing. Located right off Rte. 9 in Warrensburg, the forest is easy to get to.</p>

<h2>Winter 46er Challenge</h2>

<p>For those seeking a greater challenge, the Adirondack Mountain Club presents the challenge of climbing all 46 High Peaks (those peaks above 4,000 feet) in the winter. Note that this is only recommended for those experienced in the outdoors, backcountry survival, and winter hiking techniques.</p> 

<p>For those willing to venture up the peaks in the winter, you'll experience fewer crowds than in the peak summer and fall hiking seasons, and see incredible seasonal views. See <a href="http://www.adk46er.org/winter-46ers.html">more details on the ADK site</a>.</p>

<p>If you're plannning to venture up to the Adirondacks this winter, be sure to prepare with the proper clothing, and go with a friend who's experienced in the outdoors if you're not comfortable venturing out alone. Take some time to enjoy the winter!</p>
