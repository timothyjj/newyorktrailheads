<h1>Bradley's Lookout</h1>

<p>Officially opened by the Lake George Land Conservancy in 2020, the trail to Bradley's Lookout leads to a beautiful overlook of Lake George with less than a mile's hike one way. This trail starts from the same trailhead as <a href="https://newyorktrailheads.com/2016/07/02/The-Pinnacle.html">The Pinnacle</a> in Bolton Landing, and it can easily be combined as a hike to both overlooks (around 3.5 miles round trip to do both). </p>

<p>If you're specifically looking to hike Bradley's Lookout, park at The Pinnacle trailhead on Edgecomb Pond Road, just north of the Lake George Land Conservancy's headquarters. Once you've registered at the trailhead and started on the trail, you'll soon see a sign pointing left to The Pinnacle and right to Bradley's Lookout. Bear right, and you'll follow blue markers on a well-trafficked trail.</p>

<p>Elevation gain is minimal on this hike (174 feet), with a slight increase in hill grade at the very last push to the overlook. You'll walk approximately 0.8 miles one way to reach the viewpoint. Once there, you'll find plenty of room to spread out and enjoy a snack or drink while enjoying the view.</p>

<p>This is a perfect hike for families (and for anyone looking for a quick trek outdoors). For those looking for a more extensive adventure, in addition to adding on the Pinnacle trail, you can veer off on a connector trail to reach the summit of Cat Mountain. See the <a href="https://lglc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Pinnacle-Preserve_2021.pdf" target="_blank">official trail map</a> for further details.
