<h1>Shelving Rock Mountain</h1>

<p>One of the easiest mountaintop hikes in the Adirondacks, this trail offers a gentle climb along an old carriage road. At the top, you'll find a view overlooking the southern portion of Lake George. As part of the larger network of trails in the Lake George Wild Forest, this hike can be combined with hikes to other nearby mountains, such as Buck Mountain or Sleeping Beauty, for a more lengthy hike. You can also hike a short path to Shelving Rock Falls just down the road before the trailhead.</p>

<p>Note that you'll drive over several miles of dirt and gravel roads to get to this trail. There is a small parking lot directly where the mountain hike starts, but there are also several parking areas along the road from which you can start your hike.</p>

<p>You'll walk for approximately 1.7 miles until you reach the summit. At the top, you'll get a view of the lake that's partially blocked by trees. Continue along the worn down path until you get to a semi-open field area, and follow an unmarked but well-worn herd path to the right to get to a more open overlook area providing a view of Lake George. Note that you'll want to be careful going off the marked path to find the view, but it's a popular enough route the trail is quite frequently walked.</p>
