<h1>Hadley Mountain</h1>

<p>Located in the southern portion of the Adirondack Mountains, Hadley Mountain offers views toward the Central Adirondacks and the Great Sacandaga Lake. The trail covers close to 4 miles round trip, ascending from the base and gaining 1600 feet in elevation. The summit, burned out from fires in the past, provides a wide rocky vista. You'll also encounter an overlook as you near the top.</p>

<p>The trail ascends over very rocky terrain, typical of Adirondack trails, and is worn down from its popularity. However, the relative brevity of the hike and the rewarding views on top make this trail a perfect choice for families and for those looking for a basic hike that involves some climbing and the feeling of being out in the woods.</p>

<p>At the top, you'll find a restored fire tower, no longer officially in use but usually open for hikers to climb to the top. There's also a ranger cabin occupied by a college intern over the summer and even an outhouse for those looking for facilities to use.</p>
