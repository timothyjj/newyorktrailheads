<h1>Sleeping Beauty Mountain</h1>

<p>Starting from Dacy Clearing Road in the Lake George Wild Forest, this trail leads to the open rocky top of Sleeping Beauty, providing a wide vantage point over the southern portion of Lake George. While set back from the lake, you'll get a vista of islands, other mountains, and the opposite side of the lake.</p>

<p>The trail covers 1.8 miles each way for less than 4 miles round trip, with the option to loop around to Bumps Pond. Note that Dacy Clearing Road is only open seasonally, so you may end up walking the 1.6 miles this road covers to get to the main mountain trail.</p>
