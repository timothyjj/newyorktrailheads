<h1>Woodcock Preserve</h1>

<p>
	Run by Saratoga Plan, this preserve offers well-kept trails meandering through a mix of woodland and swamp terrain. Find a parking spot in the small lot off of Tanner Road in Clifton Park, in between Rte. 146 and Rte. 146a. Open the box at the trailhead to grab a handy laminated map showing the trail network (don't forget to put it back when you're done!). 
</p>

<p>
	A total of around 2.4 miles of trails run through the preserve. The primary loop (white trail) starts from the parking area and runs for a mile, meandering through a field before heading deeper into the woods. A couple of smaller loops, red and yellow trails, branch off at various points, while a blue trail runs for a 0.8 mile loop deeper into the woods. Note that the blue trail is closed during the spring and summer for bird nesting season.

	While I walked this trail in the late summer, when the ground was fairly dry, I did note a number of swampy and marshy areas. I would expect that spring and other rainy times may result in a muddy trail, although boardwalks laid down at various points keep you above the ground. You'll also find a few benches scattered throughout the woods to stop for a break. You may even hear a train passing nearby, as the upper portion of the trail runs close to a railroad track.

<p>
	All in all, the Woodcock Preserve provides an excellent opportunity to enjoy nature. An easily walkable, level trail is suitable for all ages, without any rough terrain to traverse.
