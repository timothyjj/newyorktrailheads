<h1>Tawasentha Park Hiking Trails</h1>

<p>The crown jewel of Guilderland's town parks, Tawasentha Park offers several miles of hiking trails going through woods and by water. Located on Rte. 146, not far off Rte. 20 heading west from Albany, the park is conveniently accessible from the general area.</p>

<p>Note that to access the main portion of the park in-season (late spring through fall), non-Guilderland residents will have to pay a fee. However, if you're just planning to hike, you can park in the Winter Recreation Area, not far past the main entrance to the park, on the left when headed south from Rte. 20. You can also park in the Community Gardens lot on the right side of the road, with additional trails accessible in that section.</p>

<p>Trails meander up and down hills, with some views to distant hills in sections, while also going past the Normans Kill for water views. There is a mix of flat terrain and some moderate climbs in sections.</p> 

<p>Watch for mud in the spring and other wet seasons! You may want to wear good hiking boots.</p>

<p>For an interesting bit of local history, look for the sign marking the Battle of Normanskill on the Community Gardens side of Rte. 146. This was the only Revolutionary War battle to be fought in Albany County.</p>
