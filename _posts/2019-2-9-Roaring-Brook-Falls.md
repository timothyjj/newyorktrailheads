<h1>Roaring Brook Falls</h1>

<p>The highest Adirondack waterfall visible from the roadside, Roaring Brook Falls cascades in splendor around 300 feet down a steep cliffside. At this popular stop in the High Peaks area, you'll find trails leading both to the base and the top of the falls, both sections offering their own unique perspective.</p>

<p>The trailhead for Roaring Brook Falls is off of Rte. 73 driving toward Lake Placid, just past the Chapel Pond trailhead that leads to Giant Mountain. There is a parking area off of the road; however, note that if this is full, New York State <a href="https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/09/17/on-road-parking-banned-near-roaring-brook-falls-in-adirondacks" target="_blank">now bans parking along the road</a> in the nearby area for traffic safety reasons. Plan to visit early in the day if possible when coming on a summer or fall weekend.</p>

<p>When walking on the trail from the parking area, keep right to follow the river and find the base of the falls (approximately 0.3 miles). Where the trail branches left, head up approximately 0.5 miles to reach the top of the falls. Be careful about walking too close to the sheer dropoff. You'll find an incredible view looking south into the High Peaks region where the waterfall meets the edge of the mountain. For more adventure and a longer hike, you can continue up the trail to reach the summit of Giant Mountain.</p>

<p>In short, this waterfall provides a beautiful short hike for those wanting to experience the beauty of the High Peaks without the strenuous climb to reach the top of a 4000-foot plus mountain. It also makes a great stop to stretch your legs when going to towns like Lake Placid or Saranac Lake.</p>
