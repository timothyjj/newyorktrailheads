<h1>Capital Hills Golf Course Walking Trail</h1>

<p>Located in the southern outskirts of the city of Albany, the Capital Hills Golf Course offers a beautiful nature trail through the extensive grounds. Covering 2.7 miles, meandering around the holes of the golf course and its rolling hills, this paved trail provides woods, fields, and outdoor scenery close to the city.</p>

<p>During times when the golf course is not open (late fall through early spring and mornings/evenings in season), visitors are also welcome to use the grounds of the golf course for winter activities such as sledding and skiing. Dog owners will also appreciate being allowed to let dogs roam freely, as long as the course is closed.</p>

<p>If you haven't been here yet, take some time to check out this beautiful outdoor resource in the city of Albany. Whether taking a run, walking a dog, or enjoying winter sports, you'll appreciate the wide open space.</p>
