<h1>Bender Melon Farm Preserve</h1>

<p>After a lengthy battle to keep this former farm from development, the Mohawk Hudson Land Conservancy purchased this plot of land in 2020. Covering 175 acres, this preserve contains a mix of woods, fields, and wetlands.</p>

<p>David's Trail currently traverses 0.57 miles through the preserve, with plans for additional trails in the future. Additionally, the property connects to the <a href="https://newyorktrailheads.com/2018/07/22/Albany-County-Rail-Trail.html">Albany County Rail Trail</a>, allowing for extending a walk over the 9 miles of paved trail. If staying on David's Trail, you'll walk on a bridge over the Rail Trail.</p>

<p>The parking area is located on Hilton Road in New Scotland, just off of Rte. 85A. There's a large gravel parking lot next to a large old red barn (the Hilton Barn), which is being restored for event use as of the time of this article.</p>

<p>We're excited to see the MHLC continue to acquire land to preserve from development and provide access for everyone to enjoy the outdoors. Take some time to visit this trail if you haven't already!</p>
