<h1>Grafton Lakes State Park </h1>

<p>This beautiful state park lies in the hills of the eastern Capital Region, halfway between Troy and the Vermont border. A trail system throughout the park takes you through the woods and around a system of ponds, with many trail options for all seasons. Fall brings beautiful colors, while winter brings a quieter park with snow-covered terrain and opportunities for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.</p>

<p>Multiple parking areas allow you to start from various points. While the trails themselves don't lead you by any overly outstanding views, you can climb a firetower for a wider perspective on the surrounding terrain.</p>

<p>In the summer, you can enjoy swimming or lounging on the small beach area. A playground for kids and a boat launch complete the options for a variety of enjoyable activities. Note that during the main season, you can expect to pay an entry fee, while accessing the park for free from late fall to early spring.</p> 

<p>When hiking, be sure to observe the <a href="https://www.avenzamaps.com/maps/101556/" target="_blank">trail map</a> closely, as the many intersecting trails can lead to potential confusion.</p>
