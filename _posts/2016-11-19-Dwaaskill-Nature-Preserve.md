<h1>Dwaas Kill Nature Preserve</h1>

<p>A relatively new natural area in Clifton Park, the Dwaas Kill Nature Preserve meanders through wooded terrain, by streams, and over a sandy hill. Trails start from two different parking areas off of Pierce Road, not far from Exit 10, with the main entrance directly across from Mazzone Hospitality. A large portion of the park consists of marshy, wetland terrain, so be prepared to walk through some muddy trail sections in wetter times of the year.</p>

<p>An orange trail climbs up along a ravine up to a point near railroad tracks, looping back down through the sandy section back to the starting point. A red trail veers off in another direction, following the small stream that winds through the woods. In addition, a couple of green connector trails lead to points along the Dwass Kill, for which the preserve was named.</p>

<p>The trail starts out relatively flat over gravel. As you branch off onto other trails, you'll walk over more natural terrain; be prepared for very slight elevation gain on the orange trail. This park is ideal for small children and for those just looking to take a quick excursion outdoors.
