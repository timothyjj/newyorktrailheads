<h1>Fisher Trail</h1>

<p>Just opened in October 2022, the Fisher Trail crosses land owned by the Mohawk Hudson Land Conservancy, ultimately connecting to established trails at the Five Rivers Environmental Education Center. The first half-mile of the Fisher Trail is designed as an accessible trail, starting with a boardwalk and leading to a wide, easy-to-traverse gravel trail winding gently through woods and fields. Several benches along the way offer spots to relax and enjoy the outdoors.</p>

<p>After reaching a beautifully constructed observation deck, the trail descends steeply into a ravine, crosses the Phillipin Kill via a bridge, and climbs back up a hill to connect with the Wild Turkey Trail. From here, you can hike into Five Rivers and cover more trails in their trail system if desired.</p>

<p>A large parking area is marked with a clear sign for the trail along Fisher Boulevard, not far off New Scotland Road (Rte. 85). An additional parking area sits by an old garage at the end of Mason Lane.</p>

<p>We're always excited to see new trails in the area, and are especially excited both for the accessible aspect of this trail and the potential to connect into the already extensive Five Rivers trail system. Be sure to take a trek on the Fisher Trail if you haven't already. Just note that no pets are allowed on the trail.</p>
