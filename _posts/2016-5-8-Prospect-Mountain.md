<h1>Prospect Mountain</h1>

<p>The hike to the top of Prospect Mountain ascends 2,000 feet over frequently rocky terrain. Once you reach the top, you'll find a parking area for the tour road that goes to the top, along with outhouse facilities and picnic tables.</p>

<p>The trail starts at a walking bridge from Smith Street in the village of Lake George. This bridge crosses the Adirondack Northway (Interstate I-87) before ascending up the mountain.</p>
