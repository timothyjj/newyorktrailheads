<h1>Capital Region First Day Hikes to Welcome 2024</h1>

<p>For outdoor enthusiasts, nothing sets the tone for a new year better than a chance to take a hike! Several local parks and nature organizations have planned First Day Hikes, where you can join others on an outdoor trek. In this article, we'll provide an overview of hikes you can participate in, along with links to further info where applicable.</p>

<h2>Adirondacks</h2>

<h3><a href="https://newyorktrailheads.com/2016/05/08/Prospect-Mountain.html">Prospect Mountain</a></h3>

<p>Starting at 10 AM from the trailhead in the village of Lake George, hike to the top of this mountain with a great view of the lake from the southern end, as well as views south to Albany and beyond on a clear day. Contact benjamin.thomas@dec.ny.gov or call (518) 623-1268 by December 28 to sign up.</p>

<h3><a href="https://newyorktrailheads.com/2016/08/13/Cat-and-Thomas-Mountains.html">Cat Mountain</a></h3>

<p>Climb up this mountain from the Bolton Landing trailhead for panoramic views north and south over Lake George. The hike, covering just over 4 miles, will begin at 9:30 AM. Contact smackey33@verizon.net or (518) 338-8173 to sign up.</p>

<h2>Saratoga County</h2>

<h3>Moreau Lake State Park</h3>

<p>Consider this park for more family-friendly hikes with younger children or those not inclined toward more intense mountain hiking. Guided hikes will be offered at 10 AM and 1 PM. Warm up with hot cocoa in the Warming Hut afterward! See the <a href="https://friendsofmoreaulake.org/2023/12/18/first-day-hike-2024/" target="_blank">Friends of Moreau Lake site</a> for more info. 

<h3>Saratoga Spa State Park</h3>

<p>Starting from the Creekside Classroom on the Geyser Loop at 10 AM, join a guided hike through the park (or snowshoe if we miraculously get snow by then, but the forecast doesn't look promising!). Registration is required; <a href="https://friendsofmoreaulake.org/2023/12/18/first-day-hike-2024/" target="_blank">visit the park website for more info or email Allison.Schweizer@parks.ny.gov.

<h2>Albany County</h2>

<h3>Thacher State Park</h3>

<p>Join a Chasing Frozen Waterfalls hike from 10:45-noon to explore woods and waters of this beautiful park in the Helderbergs. Register by calling 518-872-0800.

<h3><a href="https://newyorktrailheads.com/2019/02/09/Five-Rivers-Environmental-Education-Center.html">Five Rivers Environmental Education Center</a></h3>

<p>Explore this beautiful nature center just south of Albany on one of two guided hikes in the morning or afternoon. Reservations are required as space is limited. Call 518-475-0291 by Friday, December 29 to reserve your spot.</p>
