<h1>The Crossings of Colonie</h1>

<p>As the second largest park in the town of Colonie, The Crossings offers a peaceful oasis in the midst of a crowded suburban area just outside of Albany. With open fields, wooded sections, and a decently sized pond, you can explore a 3.25 mile trail loop around the park, with more inner connecting trails adding to the distance. The trails are mostly paved, while a wooded section in the southern portion of the park offers gravel and dirt paths. The trails are easy for families and those of all abilities to walk, run, or ride on. There are multiple areas to park throughout the property.</p>

<p>If coming to the park with kids, you'll find two playgrounds, including a larger one closer to the front entrance, as well as a smaller one in the back portion of the park that's usually somewhat quieter. You can also explore a hedge maze as well as enjoy a picnic at one of many picnic tables and pavilions scattered throughout the park.</p>

<p>Across the park road from the pond and playground area, you can meander through a field with a few trees scattered throughout. On a clear day, you can look straight south to the Helderberg mountains rising above the flatter terrain of the valley area. You may also spot cows from Constantine Farms coming up to the fence (on a summer day, head to Scoup's after your visit to the park to enjoy some ice cream made fresh from the cows' milk!).

<p>In the back section of the park, you can walk or ride a bike over a wooden bridge, as well as exploring a loop around the woods that connects back to the main trail system. You can either drive all the way in from the main Albany Shaker Road entrance or park off of Maria Drive to get to this section. All in all, this beautiful park is a great resource for residents of Colonie and the surrounding area to enjoy the outdoors.</p>
