          <h2>Find a Mountain to Climb</h2>
          <p>We've covered several upstate New York mountain hikes that will take you to the top of Adirondack peaks. Most of these are within a reasonable driving distance of the Capital Region. While varying in difficulty and distance, all of these hikes provide good to excellent views from the top. You'll find trail descriptions, photos, and maps to help you decide on your next mountain climbing adventure!</p>
