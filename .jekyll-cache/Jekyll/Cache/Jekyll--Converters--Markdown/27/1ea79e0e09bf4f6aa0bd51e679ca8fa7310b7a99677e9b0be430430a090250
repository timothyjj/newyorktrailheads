<p>This sprawling golf course, located in the southern portion of Albany, turns into a sledding, skiing, and dog walking paradise off season. A large parking lot offers plenty of room for cars even with as popular as this place gets. While a number of people often congregate around the big hill right near the parking area, there are plenty of hills throughout the course with room to find a more private spot for sledding.</p>
