I"I<h1>Lisha Kill Natural Area</h1>

<p>This beautiful preserve, located in Niskayuna and managed by the Nature Conservance, contains a rare example of an old-growth forest in the midst of the Capital Region. Just over 2 miles of trails amble through the woods and along the Lisha Kill.</p>

<p>Note that the trail is somewhat steep in sections, but can be easily walked by an adult in decent shape or kids who are confident walkers. You'll start from a trailhead off Rosendale Road, in a parking lot behind an old Grange hall. The entrance from the road is easy to miss, so look carefully for the small sign visible near the driveway to the lot.</p>

<p>Soon after entering the woods, the red trail you start on dips steeply down into a ravine. You'll follow the Lisha Kill for a bit and then encounter a bridge and some boardwalks to cross over the stream and through some muddy sections. A yellow trail branches off for a 0.4 mile loop, or you can keep following the red trail for a 1.2 mile trek.</p>

<p>You'll begin to climb back up and follow a ravine that drops steeply down to the water below. Towering trees give the illusion of being deep in the woods, even though you're not far from the populated areas of the Capital Region. At the end of the red trail, you can go on the blue trail for an additional 0.5 mile loop, or continue on the red trail to go back to the start.</p>

<p>We love this preserve and the rugged feel of some sections that make you feel like you're further away from civilization. This is a perfect hike for families (just be mindful of steeper areas when hiking with very young children or others who may not be steady on their feet). Check out the photos and map below, and visit the trail if you haven't yet!</p>
