I"’<h1>Fox Preserve</h1>

<p>Opened in 2015, this preserve is one of the Mohawk Hudson Land Conservancy's newer properties. Located in Latham on River Road, this trail is easily accessed a brief drive off of the Northway and Rte. 7. The entrance is also just across the road from a stretch of the <a href="http://newyorktrailheads.com/2016/06/04/Mohawk-Hudson-Bike-Hike-Trail.html">Mohawk Hudson Bikeway</a>, making this preserve a great stopoff from a longer trek on the bike trail. An off-road lot provides plenty of parking spaces.</p>

<p>At the entrance, a detailed sign provides a map of the trail and additional information, along with a trail register and maps you can carry on your hike. The main trail, covering just under one mile in distance, takes you up a small hill to a flat space at the top, where you can view the Mohawk River through a clearing and enjoy lunch at a picnic table. Orange markers define the main trail, while a white trail covers an additional 0.3 miles of terrain. </p>

<p>While a brief hike, this trail does entail a slight incline as you ascend to the top of the overlook. Also note you'll be walking along the edge of a steep ravine in sections, so be mindful of young children. The views of Shaker Creek along the way make you feel you're in a beautiful wooded space, and in some spots you might not realize you're so close to the busyness of Route 7 and the many homes and businesses nearby.</p>

<p>If you look closely, you'll even see a man-made waterfall in one section, on the other side of the creek, as water flows out of a pipe. Be careful about where the trail intersects with private property, as a few residences are nearby, and the road you'll walk on in one section leads to a home beyond the trail.</p>

<p>In short, this trail offers a brief but enjoyable walk through the woods, with a rewarding view at the top of the hill. Combine a trip here with walking or biking along the nearby bike trail for an enjoyable outing!</p>
