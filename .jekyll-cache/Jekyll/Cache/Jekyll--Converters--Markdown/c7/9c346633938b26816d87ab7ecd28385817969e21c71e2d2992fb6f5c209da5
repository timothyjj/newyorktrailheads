I"t<h1>Saratoga National Historical Park</h1>

<p>The location of a battle known as the turning point of the American Revolution, Saratoga National Historical Park offers a wealth of history. Covering over 3,000 acres, the battlefield area offers a wealth of opportunity for getting outside. You can hike an easy, well-kept 4.2 mile trail through woods and fields, passing a couple stops along the way to see interpretive signs. You can also bike or drive around a tour road, covering several stops along the way, including locations of encampments and important moments of the battle.</p>

<p>Starting at the interpretive center, you'll find helpful staff ready to inform you of history as well as activities available in the park. If biking the entire trail, including a loop out to a stop overlooking the Hudson River, you'll cover approximately 11.5 miles. Note that some sections will include hilly terrain that will require somewhat of a workout. Also, note park fees if visiting on season (May 1-Oct. 31) of $5 for cars and $3 for bicyclists or hikers ages 16 and up.</p>
