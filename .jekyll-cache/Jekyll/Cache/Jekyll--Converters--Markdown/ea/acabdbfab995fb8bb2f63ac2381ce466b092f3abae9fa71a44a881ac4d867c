<h2>Bear in the Woods!</h2>

<p>Did you know that bears live in the woods? And apparently parks are fully responsible for the wildlife that choose to roam free on the property?</p>

<h2>Did You Make It Past the Parking Lot?</h2>

<p>&lt;img class=â€pure-img-responsiveâ€ src=â€/img/bad-reviews/buck.pngâ€ &lt;alt=â€Bad park reviewâ€&gt;</p>

<p>This guy reviewed Buck Mountain (one of the most beautiful hikes by Lake George, in my opinion) solely based on his experience in the parking lot. Do you really expect all hiking trailheads to have facilities available? That's what the woods are for when you're hiking. Finally, not to minimize the very real problem of overcrowding in the Adirondacks, but it's a popular spot to hike. You should plan your timing accordingly to avoid crowds, and try one of many other hikes in the area if it's filled up.</p>

<h2>That Dude Who Leaves a One Star Review with No Explanation</h2>

<p>Every other review is 4+ stars. 'Nuff said.</p>
