I"*<h1>Thacher Park: Paint Mine Trail</h1>

<p>John Boyd Thacher State Park is a popular destinations for residents of the Capital Region. Located 1000 feet above sea level, the abrupt drop-offs from the Helderberg cliffs to the valleys below provide awe-inspiring scenery. While the lookout, the Indian Ladder Trail, and the Escarpment Trail are all popular destinations due to the views, the park contains much more than the cliffside trails.</p>

<p>Venture out on the Paint Mine Trail for a walk into the woods that follows a stream with cascading waterfalls. During seasons when water is plentiful, this trail provides multiple picturesque spots for views. The trail starts from the Paint Mine lot (map below); you'll find this location available in Google Maps for easy reference. You will see a sign marking the lot to the left approximately one and a half miles past the park entrance when going west on Thacher Park Road.</p>

<p>From the lot, you'll immediately see the stream just past a picnic area, with the trail starting on the right side of the stream. You'll start on a white connector trail, which will soon turn to a red trail. You can take the red loop around for a simple 1.5 mile hike out and back, or combine with other trails for a longer trek through the park.</p>

<p>The trail also connects to the Long Path, a long distance trail that extends from New York City to its end point in Thacher Park. You'll note this path and the others clearly marked on a <a href="https://parks.ny.gov/parks/128/details.aspx" target="_blank">trail map</a> available on the NYS Parks website.</p>

<p>In summary, this trail is a great introduction to scenery available in Thacher Park beyond the initial vantage points. You can also explore further to find more secluded cliff views such as <a href="http://newyorktrailheads.com/2019/07/19/High-Point.html">High Point</a> further north in the park.</p>
