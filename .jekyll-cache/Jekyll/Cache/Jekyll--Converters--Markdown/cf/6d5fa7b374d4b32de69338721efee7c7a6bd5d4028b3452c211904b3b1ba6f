I"¢<h1>Bauer Environmental Park</h1>

<p>Bauer Environmental Park, located right off Sand Creek Road in the Village of Colonie, offers a brief but peaceful stroll through the woods. With a boardwalk built over the entire trail, the path is accessible for people of all levels.</p>

<p>You can park either in the small lot off of Sand Creek Road (just west of Wolf Road across from the intersection with Delafield Drive) or in a second lot at the end of Sunset Blvd. Signs mark the entrances to the park on either end.</p>

<p>From either parking lot, a short path leads to the loop (just under one mile), which takes you on a circle through the woods. A stream meanders through the park, with a few bridge crossings as you walk. While you won't escape traffic noises from the many busy nearby roads, you'll be out of sight from buildings for a good portion of the walk, providing a surprising level of peacefulness near busy Wolf Road.</p>

<p>Note that no bicycles are allowed in the park. However, the path is perfect for walking or running, and a great spot to bring young children.</p>

<p>In short, this park offers a perfect spot to get out into the woods not far from civilization. It's easy to find, easy to navigate thanks to the boardwalk setup, and never crowded from our experience.</p>
