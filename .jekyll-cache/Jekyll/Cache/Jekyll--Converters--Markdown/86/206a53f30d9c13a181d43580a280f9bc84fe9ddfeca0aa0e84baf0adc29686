I"2<h1>Touhey Family Preserve</h1>

<p>The newest preserve in the Mohawk Hudson Land Conservancy family as of fall 2020, the Touhey Family Preserve offers boardwalks, woods, ravines, and a pond within suburbia. With land donated to the Conservancy, a well-constructed trail was built winding through the property, which even contains a view to the Helderbergs from the entrance road on a clear day.
</p>

<p>Located at 911 Delaware Avenue heading away from Albany, you'll see a sign for the preserve leading up a gravel road. Be aware that there is a private residence further up the road; pull off into the parking area to the left by the trail sign. The trail roughly makes a loop through the property; make sure you stick to the trail markers to avoid going onto other parts of the property.</p>

<p>A brief distance from the trail entrance, another short trail branches off to a small pond and a clearing. You can sit by the water and enjoy the view, and then turn around to complete the loop. You'll soon cross the gravel road that you drove on to enter the preserve (once again be sure to stick to trail markers). The trail then heads further into the woods to make a loop back around to where you parked, covering just under a mile in distance.</p>

<p>We're grateful to the Mohawk Hudson Land Conservancy for continuing to help set aside land in the Capital Region to keep it wild and allow people to enjoy the outdoors locally! Take some time to check out this preserve, and combine a trip here with other nearby preserves like the <a href="http://newyorktrailheads.com/2020/09/05/Phillipin-Kill-Preserve.html">Phillipin Kill Preserve</a> or <a href="http://newyorktrailheads.com/2019/02/09/Five-Rivers-Environmental-Education-Center.html">Five Rivers Environmental Education Center</a> for a longer hike.</p>
