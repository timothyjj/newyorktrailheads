<h2>Bear in the Woods!</h2>

<p>Did you know that bears live in the woods? And apparently parks are fully responsible for wildlife that choose to roam free on the property?</p>

<h2>Did You Make It Past the Parking Lot?</h2>

<p>&lt;img class=â€pure-img-responsiveâ€ src=â€/img/bad-reviews/buck.pngâ€ &lt;alt=â€Bad park reviewâ€&gt;</p>

<p>This guy reviewed Buck Mountain (one of the most beautiful hikes by Lake George, in my opinion) solely based on his experience in the parking lot. Do you really expect all hiking trailheads to have facilities available? That's what the woods are for when you're hiking. Finally, not to minimize the very real problem of overcrowding in the Adirondacks, but it's a popular spot to hike.
