I"	<h1>Mohawk Landing Nature Preserve</h1>

<p>Located in the western portion of the town of Clifton Park, this small nature preserve offers a boardwalk, a brief loop through the woods, and a beautiful overlook along the Mohawk River. You can also enjoy a picnic at one of the tables near the river, appreciating the splendid view on a clear day.</p>

<p>The entrance to the trail is located on Riverview Road, just past Riverview Orchards (combine a trip to this preserve with a stop at the orchard to enjoy a delicious cider donut or pick apples when in season!). A gravel parking area offers room for several cars, while signage clearly marks the entrance to the trail.</p>

<p>The walk to the river (approximately 800 feet) is brief and easy, making this a perfect outing for families with small kids or those looking for a simple outdoor excursion. While the overlook is from a slightly elevated area above the river, there is a section where you can easily walk down toward the shore of the river if you wish. Take the nature trail loop to extend your trek slightly.</p>
