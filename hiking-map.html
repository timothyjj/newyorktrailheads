<h1>Hiking Map</h1>

<p>Looking for a place to hike in (or near) the Adirondack Mountains? Check out the points on this map for several hiking options around the Lake George/Saratoga region of New York State. Note that hikes here range in difficulty levels from easy to moderate to difficult. Note that when traveling into the Adirondacks, be sure to check <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/7865.html" target="_blank">trail conditions</a>! Snow comes early at the end of the year and can stick around into late spring, followed by mud season.</p>
