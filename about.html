        <h1>About</h1>

        <div>
          <p>The goal of New York Trailheads is to encourage upstate New York residents and visitors to enjoy the great outdoors. Go for a hike or a bike ride on one of the many countless trails available!</p>
          <p>While many sites exist cataloging lists of hikes, we've found it difficult at times to pinpoint parking areas for trailheads. Finding some trails can result in confusion, searching through information on multiple sites to determine where to park and start out on the trail. We want to provide you with up-to-date maps pinpointing these exact spots.</p>
          <p>We're starting with the Capital Region up through the Lake George-Saratoga region, since that's our home area and where we spend most of our time enjoying the outdoors. However, eventually, we'd like to expand to including information about other trails around the state. Please feel free to comment with trails you'd like to see listed.</p>
